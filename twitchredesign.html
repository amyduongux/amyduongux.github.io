			<h2> Website Redesign </h2>

			<h1> Image above: Twitch Web - Stream View Redesign </h1>
			<p class="mobile-show"> For this project, I worked on the homepage and streamview as well as a landing page for Twitch as theirs currently is nonexistent. <br><br>Throughout my design process, I often showed my work to my 4 brothers, who are avid Twitch users. Their feedback was invaluable and proved to help a lot in the final design.</p>

			<h1> Image above: Twitch Chat - Before & After </h1>
			<p> This side-by-side provides a stark comparison between the current, quite bar Twitch chat UI and the new design I proposed. In the new chat design, I included a section dedicated to showcasing a streamer's Top Supporters and to display the 'Top Supporters of the Week' to encourage more streamer support from viewers; something I took from reading on UX & gamification. <br><br>And, for the cases of super active chats with tons of incoming messages that would require more chat space, I also included the option to hide the 'Top supporters' section. </p>

			<h3> WIREFRAMES </h3>

			<h3> FINAL THOUGHTS </h3>
			<p> Was super fun to work on this as a personal project because there were so many possibilities and many different routes I could have gone in terms of how the landing and home page would look like. I enjoyed giving Twitch a "revamp". I tried not to take away from what Twitch has currently in terms of their brand but there are some changes that would seem drastic to their current design i.e., hiding tons of their buttons and views. <br> <br>

			A next step would be to show more current users of Twitch and get their feedback to refine it a bit more. Then it would be nice to run an A/B test and get it in front of someone on the design team @ Twitch :) <br><br>Thanks for checking this project out <br>- Amy
